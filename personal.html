    <main id="main">
        <p>Bakar was born in London, England. He grew up his early childhood in Camden, North London.
            Bakar attended a local school for most of his early childhood. Bakar was neither poor nor extensively
            wealthy in his childhood. In his teen years he was sent
            to a boarding school in Surrey by his mother. He has descent from Yemen and Tazmania. He has
            spoken fondly of his time at boarding school as it allowed him to experience many different
            people from different places. He has often said the time he spent at boarding school were
        the most influential years of his life. Many of his songs include experiences and ideas that Bakar
        gained while he attended boarding school.</p>

        <p>Bakar grew up in London surrounded by musicians. However, he never necessarily saw himself taking the musician path.
            At this point, Bakar has been making music for about 6 years. Usually, musical artists grow up with the dream of becoming 
            famous musicians. For Bakar, however, this wasn't the case. He kind of stumbled opon his musical talent one year when
            most of his friends were on vacation. He was at home, ended up singing over a track and posting it anonymously on SoundCloud,
            and the rest is history. At first, he was only getting a few streams. Afterwards, his music began to get more support and plays
            within the British underground scene. Finally, his music began to get more and more attention until he was able to focus on it fulltime.
