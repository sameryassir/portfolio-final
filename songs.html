        <p>This list is a list of songs that Bakar has released and been the main artist on. My personal favorite
            songs of his are Hell n Back, The Mission, and 1st time. At this time, Bakar has not received any awards for
            any of his music. However, he has gotten endorsements from artists such as Skepta (British rap artist), Elton John (American
            musician) and the late Virgil Abloh (designer).
