        <p>While most people know Bakar for his music, he is also a signed model. Bakar is represented by IMG Models, an
            international modeling agency. In 2018, he modeled for the late Virgil Abloh's debut runway show for Louis Vuitton.
            In 2019 he modeled for Prada's "A Gift to Give campaign". Lately, Bakar has slowed down on the modeling in order to focus on his music.

        <p>During fashion week 2018 in Paris, Bakar modeled for Virgil Abloh's collection. His mixtape "Badkid"
            was played throughout the speakers in the historic venue where it was held. Bakar tells the story
            of walking in to Kid Cudi and Mos Def, two of his idols, blasting his music. He claims that it was
            "a mad experience". He later ended up becoming the face of the SS19 collection for Louis Vuitton.
